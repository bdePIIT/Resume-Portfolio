    <h1>Change Proposal</h1>

    <p>To effectively address the usability challenges highlighted in our usability audit of Craigslist's website, a comprehensive overhaul is warranted. Here's a detailed discussion of the necessary changes and how they will significantly enhance usability on the site:</p>

    <h3>1. Improved Navigation Structure:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li> - Implement a streamlined navigation structure that categorizes listings more intuitively. For instance, separate sections for merchandise, services, jobs, housing, and events could vastly enhance user comprehension.</li>
        <li> - Introduce a persistent navigation bar or sidebar that remains visible throughout the browsing experience, allowing users to effortlessly navigate between sections and return to the home page from any point on the site.</li>
        <li> - Consider implementing customizable navigation options, allowing users to personalize their browsing experience based on their preferences and frequently accessed categories.</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h3>2. Enhanced Search Functionality:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> - Revamp the search functionality to provide more refined results based on user queries. Incorporating filters such as location, price range, date, and category would empower users to narrow down their searches effectively.</li>
        <li> - Enhance the search algorithm to yield more accurate and relevant results, reducing instances of irrelevant listings cluttering the search results page.</li>
        <li> - Integrate advanced search features such as natural language processing (NLP) and predictive search suggestions to anticipate user intent and deliver more accurate results.</li>
        <li> - Explore the possibility of incorporating geolocation technology to provide location-based search results, enabling users to find relevant listings based on their proximity.</li>
        
    </ul>
