    <h1>Problem and Research Methods</h1>

    <p>In summary, Craigslist's website presents significant usability challenges. Users find it difficult to navigate, especially when attempting to return to the home page. The site's organization lacks clarity, resulting in a verbose and disorganized browsing experience. Furthermore, its visual aesthetics are deemed unappealing by users. These issues collectively impede user satisfaction and highlight the need for comprehensive improvements to enhance usability and visual appeal.</p>
    <p>The research methodology involved administering a survey to users, wherein they were tasked with completing specified actions and subsequently rating the ease of each task. This structured approach enabled systematic data collection regarding user experiences and perceptions, facilitating insightful analysis and informed decision-making regarding usability enhancements.</p>
