    <h1>Usability Audit</h1>

    <p>Our usability audit employed a structured approach to gather insights into user experience through task-based surveys. We meticulously designed the survey, selecting tasks relevant to our product/service and crafting clear instructions for participants. Recruitment efforts targeted our desired demographic via various channels, ensuring a diverse pool of participants. During data collection, participants were guided through tasks and asked to rate their performance on a 1-5 scale. Analysis of survey responses revealed valuable insights into user behavior, highlighting both strengths and areas for improvement. From these findings, actionable recommendations were formulated to enhance usability.</p>
